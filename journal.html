     "Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House ..."</p>

        <br><br>
        i enjoyed Schwulst's explanation of what a website is in a more basic sense as she compares it to everyday objects and spaces, and i particularly enjoy the comparison of a website to a garden. these seedlings of ideas, concepts, can bloom to not only form a completed website, but they can continue to grow and expand with the gardeners knowledge.

    <p>"Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology"</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> response: 
        <br><br>
        along side this class, i read this article for another class i am in this semester, and i really enjoy the analysis of what technology truly is and how basic it can really be. technology is mostly seen as high-tech, but breaking it down into the beginning of technology- like when wheels were invented- and understanding that if we didnt have these very small, yet impactful, technologies in the past, then we would not have what we do now.

    "J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web"</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> response:
        <br><br>
        personally, i enjoy making everything by hand, such as clothes, jewelry, books, blankets, you name it- i've probably tried it.  this is such a wonderful article to read, and i particularly enjoyed the quote: "i evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books." this statement really explains why i am so drawn to code and enjoy it as much as i do (which is a shock to me!) the beauty of handmaking objects comes through with handmade and hand crafted websites.
