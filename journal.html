     "Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House ..."</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> response: 
        <br><br>
        i enjoyed Schwulst's explanation of what a website is in a more basic sense as she compares it to everyday objects and spaces, and i particularly enjoy the comparison of a website to a garden. these seedlings of ideas, concepts, can bloom to not only form a completed website, but they can continue to grow and expand with the gardeners knowledge.

    <p>"Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology"</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> response: 
        <br><br>
        along side this class, i read this article for another class i am in this semester, and i really enjoy the analysis of what technology truly is and how basic it can really be. technology is mostly seen as high-tech, but breaking it down into the beginning of technology- like when wheels were invented- and understanding that if we didnt have these very small, yet impactful, technologies in the past, then we would not have what we do now.

    "J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web"</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> response:
        <br><br>
        personally, i enjoy making everything by hand, such as clothes, jewelry, books, blankets, you name it- i've probably tried it.  this is such a wonderful article to read, and i particularly enjoyed the quote: "i evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books." this statement really explains why i am so drawn to code and enjoy it as much as i do (which is a shock to me!) the beauty of handmaking objects comes through with handmade and hand crafted websites.

        "Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!"</p>
        <p style="color:darkred;"> response:
            <br><br>
            i really enjoyed the mixed visuals of type and watercolor illustrations within the pages, as it made the format easier to read and take in. it is amazing to learn the history of computers, as most people are used to the user interface of it and not the mechanics behind it, and how real people were the first computers. also, i did not realize how interconnected computers and art are, so discovering that and their connections and similar origins was pretty neat!

        "Callum Copley, A Friend is Writing"</p>
        <p style="color:darkred;"> response:
            <br><br>
            interacting or even just exisitng on this website is overwhwelming, and it makes me feel stressed! as i have been just typing my response, i have gotten 80 notifications so far, and i am definitely someone who dislikes notification bubbles. also, the amount of interaction with this website is really intriguing and like nothing i have seen before. additionally, i really liked the quote:<br><br>
            "a homogenization of features amongst the leading platforms displays an obvious intention to dominate the market."<br><br>
            personally, i really don't like the overlapping of features on social media platforms, like each app has "stories" or "reels" or something similar, which feels too close to tiktok. now, with this explanation, it makes a lot more sense why companies and platforms do this.

        "Frank Chimero, The Web's Grain"</p>
        <p style="color:darkred;"> response:
            <br><br>
            the overall concept of stripping web design down and creating with "the web's grain" makes a lot of sense, especially when looking over the apple mac pro website and realizing how disjointed and unnatural it feels to navigate. i enjoyed looking at hockney's work, specifically the scrabble game, as i felt like it displayed how i take in information. little pieces or pictures of information flood into my brain and then i subconsciously combine them in a way to get a full image similar to hockney's work. i also found it intriguing how many people, myself included, often create websites in this box form, when they do not need to be confined to that shape, and they can just flow without structure or borders or edges.
